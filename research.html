    		<p><strong>Cred Lab:</strong> During the 2018-2019 academic year, 
    		I participated in the <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/sciencecenter/students/opportunities/serp">
    		Sophomore Early Research Program</a> and conducted research 
    		with the Wellesley College Cred Lab under the guidance of 
    		<a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/cs/faculty/mustafaraj">Professor Eni Mustafaraj</a>.</p>
    		<p> My work during the academic year and the following summer 
    		focused on website credibility. Due to the rise of 
    		misinformation during the 2016 United States presidential election, 
    		I was particularly interested in studying the process by which internet users 
    		assess the credibility of information on the web and the role Google plays in the 
    		dissemination of information on the internet. </p>
    		<p> Visit the <a href="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~credlab/">
			Wellesley College Cred Lab</a> website for more information. In addition, 
			an <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/news/2018/stories/node/161316">article</a> 
			on the Wellesley College website discusses one of our most recent projects.</p>
			<p><strong>Chemistry Lab:</strong> From 2017-2018, I worked as a member of a 
			Physical Chemistry Lab at Wellesley College led by 
			<a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/chemistry/facultystaff/arumainayagam">Professor Chris Arumainayagam</a>. 
			Our lab was particularly interested in the chemical reactions occurring within ice 
			in low-pressure environments. By studying these reactions, we hoped to gain a better 
			understanding of the formation of molecules and stars in the interstellar medium.
